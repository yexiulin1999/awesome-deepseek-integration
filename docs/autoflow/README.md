[AutoFlow](https://github.com/pingcap/autoflow) is an open-source knowledge base tool based on GraphRAG (Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation), built on [TiDB](https://www.pingcap.com/ai?utm_source=tidb.ai&utm_medium=community) Vector, LlamaIndex, and DSPy. It provides a Perplexity-like search interface and allows easy integration of AutoFlow's conversational search window into your website by embedding a simple JavaScript snippet.

## UI

1. **Perplexity-style Conversational Search page**: Our platform features an advanced built-in website crawler, designed to elevate your browsing experience. This crawler effortlessly navigates official and documentation sites, ensuring comprehensive coverage and streamlined search processes through sitemap URL scraping.
