Coco AI is a unified search platform that connects all your enterprise applications and data—Google Workspace, Dropbox, Confluent Wiki, GitHub, and more—into a single, powerful search interface. This repository contains the **COCO App**, built for both **desktop and mobile**. The app allows users to search and interact with their enterprise data across platforms.

In addition, COCO offers a **Gen-AI Chat for Teams**—imagine **Deepseek** but tailored to your team’s unique knowledge and internal resources. COCO enhances collaboration by making information instantly accessible and providing AI-driven insights based on your enterprise's specific data.
